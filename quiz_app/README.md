#### Team

Colomberotto Teo, Kalberer Yves, Robert Thomas

## Project scope

The aim of this project is to create a simple pokemon quiz mobile application.

Anyone born in the 1990s will remember the animated series Pokemon and the enormous number of commercials that breaking up each episode. At the beginning of each commercial pause, the silhouette of a mysterious pokemon was shown and the goal was to recognazie the pokemon. At the end of the advertisement we would know if our guess was correct.

This quiz works the same. Once the quiz started a fixed number of mysterious pokemon will appear to the user in succession. The goal of the user is to guess as many Pokemon as possible before time runs out. A final score will be shown at the end and the user will have the possbiility to save his score in a leaderboard.

### Project Technical Features

- Implement a remote firebase environnement. Cloud Firestore and Storage are used in order to stock pokemons and scores data.
- Implemented in Flutter using Advanced design patterns such as Bloc, Repository Patterns and a MVC paradigm.
- Implement an internet connection check to ensure that the user is connected in order to take advantage of the app.
